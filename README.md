This project uses Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Clean Architecture. 
All user interaction occurs within the View, which is in charge of detecting 
the user‚Äôs input (user's clicks, keyboard input) and forwarding it to the ViewModel.

The ViewModel is the link between the View and the Model. 
It implements and exposes public properties and commands that 
the View uses by way of data binding. If any state changes occur, 
the ViewModel notifies the View through notification events.

The Models are classes that model the application‚Äôs domain. 
Models encapsulate the application‚Äôs data and business logic. 
They can be considered business objects that have absolutely no 
relation to the visual aspect of the application.
